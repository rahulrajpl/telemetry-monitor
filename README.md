# Telemetry-monitor
A web application which can monitor the satellite telemetry data received at the ground station and 
detect a potential stealthy attack on satellite based on anomaly detection techniques.

## Stealthy Attack detection

This application uses a mathematical technique called singular spectrum analysis to detect the potential 
cyber attack on satellite by modifying the telemetry data.
